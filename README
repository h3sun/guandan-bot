## Progress Log
### Week 1 – Monte Carlo Self-Play Demo ✅
- Implemented minimal Monte Carlo self-play loop (`rl_core/mc_selfplay_demo.py`)
- Studied MDP, Monte Carlo, and self-play mechanisms
- Next: connect to Guandan environment (`guandan_mcc/env`)

### Guandan Engine (current)
- Added pure-functional rule engine under `guandan_engine/` with full pattern validation, trump logic, tribute, and level progression helpers.
- Includes CLI helper (`python -m guandan_engine.ui_cli --trump-level 10 --cards "S2 S3 S4 S6 H10"`) for quick pattern inspection and a demo mode (`--demo --seed 0`) that deals a random hand and lists legal openings.
- Run unit tests with `python -m pytest tests/test_guandan_engine.py`.
